# Elite Fidget Mode - Segmentation Fault Fix Summary

## Critical Issue
The fidget mode application was experiencing segmentation faults (exit code 134) after some time of operation, indicating memory access violations and improper resource management.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Timer Resource Leaks**
- QTimer objects created without parent widgets
- Timer callbacks executing after parent widgets destroyed
- No proper timer cleanup on widget destruction

### 2. **Memory Management Issues**
- Widget destruction without proper resource cleanup
- Circular references in signal/slot connections
- Theme manager registrations without unregistration

### 3. **Animation Object Persistence**
- QPropertyAnimation objects persisting after parent destruction
- Animation callbacks accessing destroyed widget memory
- No cleanup of animation groups

### 4. **Paint Event Crashes**
- paintEvent() executing on destroyed widgets
- Access to freed image resources during painting
- No safety checks in drawing methods

### 5. **Theme Manager Issues**
- Widget registration without cleanup
- Dangling references after widget destruction
- Missing error handling in theme operations

## Comprehensive Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Resource Cleanup Framework**

#### Widget Lifecycle Management
- Added `_is_destroyed` and `_cleanup_performed` flags to all widgets
- Implemented comprehensive `cleanup_resources()` methods
- Added proper destructor methods with cleanup calls

#### Timer Safety
```python
# Before: Unsafe timer creation
self.animation_timer = QTimer()

# After: Safe timer with parent
self.animation_timer = QTimer(self)  # Automatic cleanup
```

#### Signal Disconnection
```python
def cleanup_resources(self):
    if self.animation_timer:
        self.animation_timer.stop()
        self.animation_timer.timeout.disconnect()  # Prevent callbacks
        self.animation_timer.deleteLater()
        self.animation_timer = None
```

### 2. **Safe Animation System**

#### Protected Animation Updates
```python
def safe_update_animations(self):
    """Safely update animations with destruction check"""
    if self._is_destroyed or self._cleanup_performed:
        return
    try:
        self.update_animations()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Animation update error: {e}")
        self.cleanup_resources()
```

#### Paint Event Protection
```python
def paintEvent(self, event: QPaintEvent):
    """Paint with comprehensive safety checks"""
    if self._is_destroyed or self._cleanup_performed:
        return
        
    painter = QPainter(self)
    try:
        # Safe painting with error handling
        self._safe_paint_content(painter)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Paint error: {e}")
        # Continue with basic background
        painter.fillRect(self.rect(), self.palette().window())
    finally:
        painter.end()
```

### 3. **Memory Management Improvements**

#### Theme Manager Safety
```python
def cleanup_resources(self):
    # Unregister from theme manager
    try:
        get_global_theme_manager().unregister_widget(self)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not unregister from theme manager: {e}")
```

#### Image Resource Cleanup
```python
# Clear image references
if hasattr(self, 'ship_image'):
    self.ship_image = None
if hasattr(self, 'original_ship_image'):
    self.original_ship_image = None
    
# Clear data structures
if hasattr(self, 'scan_points'):
    self.scan_points.clear()
```

### 4. **Defensive Programming**

#### Error Handling in Critical Methods
```python
def on_viewer_rotation_changed(self, delta: float):
    """Handle viewer rotation change with safety checks"""
    if self.ship_viewer and hasattr(self.ship_viewer, 'set_rotation'):
        try:
            # Safe operation with proper attribute checking
            self.ship_viewer.hover_phase += delta * 0.1
            self.ship_viewer.update()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning: Viewer rotation change failed: {e}")
```

#### Safe Widget Access
```python
def update_ship_displays(self):
    """Update displays with comprehensive error handling"""
    if not self.current_ship:
        return
    
    try:
        if self.ship_viewer:
            try:
                self.ship_viewer.set_ship(self.current_ship)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Warning: Failed to update ship viewer: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in update_ship_displays: {e}")
```

### 5. **Crash Prevention Mechanisms**

#### Application-Level Cleanup
```python
def closeEvent(self, event):
    """Handle window close with proper cleanup"""
    print("EliteFidgetMode: Close event received, performing cleanup...")
    self.cleanup_resources()
    event.accept()

def __del__(self):
    """Destructor with cleanup"""
    try:
        self.cleanup_resources()
    except Exception:
        pass
```

#### Global Cleanup Handler
```python
def cleanup_application(window):
    """Global cleanup function for application shutdown"""
    if window and hasattr(window, 'cleanup_resources'):
        try:
            window.cleanup_resources()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during global cleanup: {e}")
```

### 6. **Safe Application Launcher**

Created `launch_fidget_safe.py` with:
- Comprehensive crash protection and recovery
- Automatic retry mechanisms (up to 3 attempts)
- Signal handlers for graceful shutdown
- Periodic health checks during runtime
- Memory monitoring and garbage collection
- Timeout protection for widget creation

### 7. **Stability Testing Framework**

Implemented `test_stability.py` with:
- Import safety testing
- Widget creation/cleanup cycle testing
- Memory leak detection
- Theme manager safety validation
- Rapid startup/shutdown cycle testing
- Comprehensive test reporting
